Question Number,Prompt
1,"Professionally condense and explain the material relevant to how allosteric activators, such as AMP, influence enzyme kinetics (specifically Km and Vmax) in the context of skeletal muscle glycogen phosphorylase, including the biochemical definition of Km as substrate concentration at half-maximal velocity, the role of conformational changes in increasing substrate affinity, and the physiological significance of AMP as a fasting signal that upregulates glycogenolysis when cellular energy status is depleted."
2,"Professionally condense and explain the clinical presentation, laboratory findings (pancytopenia with thrombocytopenia, anemia, and leukocytosis with >20% blasts on peripheral smear), and unique physical markers like gingival hypertrophy associated with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), including the distinction between myeloid and lymphoid lineages, the specific presentation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) subtype, risk stratification based on cytogenetic mutations, and standard induction therapy with cytarabine and anthracyclines (7+3 regimen)."
3,"Professionally condense and explain the expected motor, social, and verbal/cognitive developmental milestones for a 3-month-old infant according to standard pediatric developmental assessments, including gross motor skills (head control when prone), fine motor abilities, social interaction patterns, and language development expectations at this age."
